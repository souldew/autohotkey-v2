The Lighthouse Keeper's Discovery
Sarah had been the lighthouse keeper on Gull's Rest Island for three years, but she had never seen anything quite like this. The storm had passed just before dawn, leaving behind a peculiar shimmer on the water that seemed to dance with its own light.

As she climbed the spiral stairs to check the beacon, something caught her eye on the rocky shore below. A small, ornate chest had washed ashore, its brass fittings gleaming despite what must have been years underwater.

When Sarah reached the beach, she discovered the chest was surprisingly light. Inside, instead of gold or jewels, she found dozens of glass bottles, each containing what appeared to be a rolled piece of parchment. The first message she opened was written in elegant handwriting:

"To whoever finds this: I am Captain James Morrison of the merchant vessel Seraphina. If you are reading this, then my experiment has worked. These bottles contain not messages, but memories of the most beautiful sunsets I have witnessed in thirty years at sea. Hold the bottle up to the light, close your eyes, and you'll see what I saw."

Sarah lifted the bottle toward the morning sun. As the light passed through the glass, she suddenly found herself standing on the deck of a ship, watching the sky bloom into shades of amber and rose she had never imagined possible.

She had found something far more valuable than treasure—she had found wonder itself.
